Hi,
I was trying to integrate workflow designer with the sdc by following this link https://github.com/onap/sdc-sdc-workflow-designer 
but I am getting plugin not available error on the workflow tab. I am attaching my running docker containers(SDC and workflow containers) details and plugin-config,yaml image. please let me know what might be the problem.I have used docker host IP in plugin-config.yaml file.
Thanks,
