1. Barometer collects system metrics and events to aid in the monitoring of the NFVI and provide means for these metrics 
   and events to be relayed to higher level fault management systems for enforcement and corrective actions

2. Barometer uses collectd to collect the system metrics, and works closely with the collectd community

3. Increasing the automated test coverage benifits collectd as well as Barometer

4. Major work items for the Jerma release are improving the test infrastructure for collectd 
   (particularly for Barometer-contributed plugins)

5. This project will involve automating existing tests for individual plugins

6. Config files directory is mapped as virtual shared directory to 
   barometer-collectd container in /opt/collectd/etc/collectd.conf.d directory.
